Euler
=====

These are my solutions for Project Euler.

Probably only interesting if you like ancient programming languages.

Ooh, but if you *are* interested - note how pretty code is when
parentheses round off all the sharp edges.  

Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant language for a 
more civilized age... 

I figure if I can't use it at work I may as well use it for fun.
